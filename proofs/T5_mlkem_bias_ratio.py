T5 — ML-KEM raw-RNG bias ratio
================================

Paper §6 Limitation L9 (mask uniformity scope).

Statement
---------
A 12-bit RNG produces uniform values on {0, 1, ..., 4095}. When these
values are reduced modulo q = 3329 to feed Z_q-valued masks (the naive
"raw RNG" path), the resulting distribution on Z_q is non-uniform:

  • residues 0 ≤ r ≤ 766 receive probability 2 / 4096 each,
  • residues 767 ≤ r ≤ 3328 receive probability 1 / 4096 each.

The maximum bias ratio is exactly 2.

This number anchors the L9 ("mask uniformity") caveat in §6: if a
deployer uses raw 12-bit RNG without rejection sampling or two-draw
mixing, the mask is biased by at most 2× per residue, and Theorem
3.9.1 (assumption A2: mask uniform on Z_q) is violated.

Implementation
--------------
Pure-Python exhaustive enumeration is the canonical proof: we iterate
over every 12-bit value v ∈ [0, 4096), tally counts[v % q], and check
the resulting distribution against the closed-form bound. No SMT is
needed because the domain is finite and small (4096 values).

We additionally run a Z3 *self-consistency check* of the closed-form
predicate ⌈(4096 − r) / q⌉ against itself: for every residue r, the
predicate "r + expected*q ≥ N AND r + (expected − 1)*q < N" with
expected = ITE(r < 767, 2, 1) holds. This is NOT an independent proof
of the count — it is a redundancy check that the closed form is
internally consistent and that the boundary value 767 is correct.
The pure-Python enumeration is the load-bearing artifact; Z3 and CVC5
serve as cross-checks against transcription error in the closed form.
